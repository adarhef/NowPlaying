  # SQLite ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SQLite is in the Public Domain.  All of the code and documentation in 
  SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All 
  code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have 
  signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain 
  and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at 
  the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, 
  use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in 
  source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial 
  or non-commercial, and by any means.

  The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and 
  documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you 
  actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used 
  as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts 
  generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. 
  Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable 
  SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those 
  scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and 
  use the SQLite library.

  All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. 
  No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. 
  Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all 
  of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite 
  code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other 
  projects.
